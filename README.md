# Deck-Builder
Made using Mongo, Express, React and Node in Javascript, CSS, and HTML

# To Run
Set up a MongoDB database and replace the connection link in server -> src -> index.js with your own. Then create two terminals, and change their directories: one to "server" and another to "client". Run "npm start" on both. This will launch the application in "localhost:3000".
